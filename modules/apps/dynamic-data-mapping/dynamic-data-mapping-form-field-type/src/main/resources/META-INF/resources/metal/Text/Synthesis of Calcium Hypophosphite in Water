Instructions

    1. Dissolve 126,7g of NaPO₂H₂.H₂O in 130ml of distilled water. Add a little heat if it gets hard to dissolve it all.

    2. Dissolve 65,28g of CaCl₂ in 90ml of distilled water.

    3. Mix both solution and stir for 5 minutes. Add a little heat to help the reacton to happen.

    At this point, you should have a solution with 68,9g of NaCl mostly dissolved and 100g of Ca(H₂PO₂)₂ of which 33,88g will be dissolved and the rest 66,12g should have precipitaed.

    Pass the solution through a coffee filter, extract the paste and let it dry in an oven for an hour (or until it look dry).

    That's it. You have your Calcium Hypophosphite. This method is not very efficient because it makes you lose almost 34% to the solution. But it's easy enough that anyone can do and you don't have to mess with flamable chemicals like methanol.
